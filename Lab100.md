## Lab 100: Creat and Use a Power BI dataset


We want to create a PowerBI dataset in Synapse that we can use to build a report.

## Business Requirement

We want to eventually create a report in Power BI that connects to our Synapse data.  That can either be dedicated pool data or SQL Serverless data.  

We'll let you pick the data and experiment with Power BI integration.  

### Steps

* Add your PowerBI workspace as a Linked Service in your Synapse workspace
* Under `Develop` you should see `Power BI` and `Power BI datasets` 
* `+ New Power BI dataset`
* Choose either your SQL Dedicated Pool or On-Demand Pool.  
* You will likely be asked to create a .pbids file that contains the data source connstrings.  Do that and it should open with PBI Desktop.  
* For now, just add your dataset, don't bother building any visualizations at this time.  
* Try using `DirectQuery` to see what the query response times eventually look like using PBI.  
* When you are ready choose `Publish to Power BI` and publish to your workspace.  
* Go back to Synapse Studio and refresh your PBI dataset.  Your new PBI dataset should be visible.  
* NOW you can build any report directly in the Studio experience, or in Power BI desktop.  

### Notes

* If you don't see the list of data fields you will need to login to your PBI workspace, go to Settings|Datasets and doublecheck your credentials.  These should be set to `Authentication method = OAuth2`.
