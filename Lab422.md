# Use a model for batch scoring against Synapse Dedicated data

_Make sure you complete Lab 420 and Lab 421 first_

1. In Lab 420 you copied the prepped data to your Synapse Pool and likely called it `dbo.nyc_taxi_prepped`.
1. Right click that table and choose `Enrich with existing ML model`.  We will use the model we trained in Lab421 to inference against this dataset.
1. Follow the prompts
1. Create the stored proc with any name
1. The table for the model can be anything but a good convention is `dbo.models`

**Try to understand what the code is doing for batch inferencing.  You can of course alter this code to fit your needs.**

`variable1` in this case is the prediction that we trained on, likely the target was fare_amount.
