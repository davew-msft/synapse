## Success Criteria

1. Spin up a workspace in your Azure Subscription 
    * this only needs to be done by 1 member of the team and everyone can share that workspace
1. Add other users/team as needed to the workspace.  Process:
    * Assign them to the Contributor role on workspace
    * Assign them to a Workspace, SQL, or Spark admin role using Synapse Studio
    * Assign yourself and others to the Storage Blob Data Contributor role on the storage account 


## Optional: Setup a Spark Pool

Make sure you setup auto-pause to control costs.  

If you do this you need to configure security so the spark pool can connect to the storage account
* Assign the workspace MSI to the Storage Blob Data Contributor role on the storage account
* Assign the team to the Storage Blob Data Contributor role on the storage account
