## Lab 002 import sample data into Synapse

We want to gain experience with the Synapse workspace UI.

1. Open Synapse studio
1. Go to `Data` section, expand `+`, then `Browse Samples`
1. Bring in `Covid Tracking Project` 
1. This creates a "link" to the dataset, it does not import it.  
1. `Select TOP 100 Rows`.  Note:  the file is in parquet format and we are opening the file from the _public_ data lake using a Serverless SQL Pool.  
1. Now load the data into our data lake using `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` on the context menu.  


## Investigate some sample data notebooks

These notebooks are great tutorials.  

Try these:

* `Read and write data from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2`
* `Query Parquet Files`
