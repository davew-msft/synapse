 ## Lab 003 (Optional): Configure additional users to access a Synapse workspace

For each additional user that needs to have access to the workspace:

* Assign the Reader role on the WorkspaceResourceGroup to the user.
* Assign the Reader and Blob Data Contributor roles on the PrimaryStorage to the user.
* Assign the Workspace admin role in the Workspace to the user.
* Grant access to the `SQLPool01` to the user using the script below. You must be signed in with the MasterUser credentials (use SQL Server Management Studio if the script fails in Synapse Studio).

```sql
CREATE USER [<user_principal_name>] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER;
EXEC sp_addrolemember 'db_owner', '<user_principal_name>';
```

In the script above, replace <user_principal_name> with Azure Active Directory user principal name of the user.
