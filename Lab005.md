## Create a Linked Service  

TODO

Practice creating a linked service.  In this case we'll connect to my sample datasets storage account to leverage that data in later labs.

* Under Linked choose `Connect to External data`
* Azure Blob Storage
* call it `davesdemoblobs` or equivalent

* SAS URL:  `https://davewdemoblobs.blob.core.windows.net`
* SAS token: `?sv=2019-12-12&ss=btqf&srt=sco&st=2018-02-23T17%3A18%3A00Z&se=2032-05-24T16%3A18%3A00Z&sp=rl&sig=5GnpyfFM%2F5Es1p9uXq%2B7Fo3ZObO530AoVnjNlpS7%2FAw%3D`

Note:  the SAS above is pointed to the root storage account.

You are probably expecting to see the linked service listed in your workspace.  But it won't be.  For security, the Synapse service needs access to the SAS token via a role assignment.  Let's do that:

* Go to `Manage|Linked Services` and find `davesdemoblobs` then `view role assignments`
